# University Practice

Thing I did in university for my Java applied programming course.

# Can I use it?

If it comparable with your task - sure, why not. But I really suggest you to read the code and make some comments for yourself.

# What I Learned?

- Basic concepts of OOP;
- Classes and methods in Java;
- JavaFX;
- Little bit of algorithms.
